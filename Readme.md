SmartUse GL JS is a JavaScript library to enable visual mapbased storytelling. It's based on Mapbox GL JS and takes map styles that conform to the Mapbox Style Specification, applies them to vector tiles that conform to the Mapbox Vector Tile Specification, and renders them using WebGL. It adds the ability to specify a sequence of layer and style combinations. It also is built to host map annotations.

A deployment wide set of layers and styles as well as project specific ones are supported. Additionally a configuration file defines the storyline and parameters.

SmartUse GL is part of the SmartUse ecosystem of Tools around Geodata and related datasets.
